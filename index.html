<p>The game is modeled on a Virtual World ‘Utopia’, where the soil, air, water, effective sunlight, different plants, animals, humans and even Industries are mutually dependent on each other for survival and prosperity. The quality and populations of these species changes continuously as functions of the Biotic and Abiotic components of the Environment. The different Species are the part of an elaborate Food-Web which also links to Humans, Industries, and the Abiotic Environment. They however, are caught in the crossfire between ‘Bob’ and ‘Marley’.
The player, ‘Bob’ must fulfill his destiny, his Karma – To sustain and preserve life on earth using Heavenly Potions and Industrial Concoctions. On the other hand, ‘Marley’ (which shall be the AI) wants to convert Utopia into a cursed wasteland – using Hellish Poisons and Industrial Wastes.</p>
